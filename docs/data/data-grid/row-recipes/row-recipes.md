## One expanded detail panel at a time

By default, the [Master detail <span class="plan-pro" />](/x/react-data-grid/master-detail/) feature supports multiple expanded detail panels simultaneously.

However, you can [control the expanded detail panels](/x/react-data-grid/master-detail/#controlling-expanded-detail-panels) to have only one detail panel expanded at a time.
