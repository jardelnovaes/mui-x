# Installation

<p class="description">Install the necessary packages to start building with MUI X components.</p>

MUI X packages are available through the free MIT-licensed Community plan, or the commercially-licensed Pro and Premium plans.
See [the licensing page](/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

## Peer dependencies

MUI X components have a peer dependency on `@mui/material`: the installation [instructions](/material-ui/getting-started/installation/).

## Components

Note that you only need to install the packages corresponding to the components you're usingâ€”e.g. data grid users don't need to install date and time pickers.
