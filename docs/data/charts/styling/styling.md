# Charts - Styling

<p class="description">This page groups topics about charts customistion.</p>

## Colors

### Series color

Series accepts a property `color` which is the base color used to render its components.

```jsx
<LineChart series={[{ ..., color: '#fdb462'}]} />
```

{{"demo": "BasicColor.js"}}

### Color palette

Charts come with built-in color palettes to automatically assign colors to series.
If a particular series lacks a color prop, the chart will default to assigning a color based on the series' index.

You can set a custom color palette by using the prop `colors` on chart components (or `<ChartContainer />` if you are using composition).
This prop takes an array of colors, or callback whose input is the theme's mode (`'dark'` or `'light'`) and returns the array of colors.

#### Provided palettes

The library includes three palettes.

{{"demo": "MuiColorTemplate.js"}}

#### Custom palettes

Those palettes can also be generated by using [d3-scale-chromatic](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes).
Or any color manipulation library you like.

Here is an example of the d3 Categorical color palette.

## Styling

### Size

By default, charts adapt their sizing to fill their parent element.
However, you can modify this behavior by providing `height` and/or `width` props.

Those will fix the chart's size to the given value (in px).

### Placement

At the core of chart layout is the drawing area which corresponds to the space available to represent data.

This space can be defined with the `margin` prop and its properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
Those values define the space between the SVG border and the drawing area.

You might want to modify those values to leave more space for your axis ticks or reduce them to provide more space for the data.

{{"demo": "MarginNoSnap.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "playground"}}

### CSS

Since the library relies on SVG for rendering, you can customize them as you do with other MUI components with CSS overriding.

Chart components accept the `sx` props.
From here, you can target any subcomponents with its class name.
