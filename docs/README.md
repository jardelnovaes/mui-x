# MUI X docs

This is the documentation website of MUI X.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```bash
yarn && yarn docs:dev
```

If you do not have yarn installed, select your OS and follow the instructions on the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

_DO NOT USE NPM, use Yarn to install the dependencies._
